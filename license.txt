New license
-----------

Previous versions of CppUnitLite were not released with an explicit license. To
make things clear, I explicitly added the license text for the MIT license with
an added restriction. The MIT license allows you to use the code in any
project, commercial or otherwise, without any restrictions. The added
restriction to the license prohibits its use in any military applications or
projects with any military funding.
